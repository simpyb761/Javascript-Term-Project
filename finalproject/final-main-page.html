            Audience: Anyone interested in medieval times or knight tournaments/aesthetic. 
            Games contain relatively simple logic so children can play.
            Interface: designed for simplicity in the interface to make the games the main focus of users.
            Design Layout: Currently planned to have images/ game material front and center taking the majority of the page.
            Links, headers and instructions will be present but have smaller role to limit distractions from gameplay. 
            Color scheme: Currently monochromatic with variations of blue throughout the pages. This will be tweaked as games are completed. 
            Current plan is to make the pages hopefully look more rustic to compliment medieval times. The knight tournament page
            should look regal to signify importance of t he tournament.
