This game is a simple game of rock, paper, and scissors but contains a twist. 
Quick attacks beat strong attacks, blocks beat quick attacks, and strong attacks beat blocks.

This game is targeted towards any audience. The overall concept is easy to grasp for most ages. 
For later releases, I would like to add buttons to click for using attacks instead of typing in values!
This will positively impact user experience while playing the game.
